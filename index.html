            <p>The Gotham Ruby Conference, a one-day, single-track event in New York City, is now accepting proposal papers. GoRuCo will be held on Saturday, June 4th 2011 on the Manhattan campus of Pace University.</p>
            <p>GoRuCo is a technical conference aimed at highly motivated programmers interested in all things Ruby. You'll spend the day among leading Rubyists, innovators and developers in New York City, home of Silicon Alley. Past topics have ranged from pragmatic new approaches to design and testing, to pioneering language application and far-reaching abstractions.</p>
            <p>We will have around six slots, depending on the quantity and quality of the proposals we receive.</p>
            <div id='speaker-highlight'>
              <h3>Speakers</h3>
              <p>The majority of the day's content will be individual talks. Talks should be at most 40 minutes long, including time for questions and discussion.</p>
              <h4>Speakers receive</h4>
              <ul class='rewards'>
                <li class='ticket'>Free admission</li>
                <li class='money'>$300 honorarium</li>
                <li class='travel'>$600 travel reimbursement if you live outside of the tri-state region</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Local speakers</h4>
              <p>GoRuCo believes in highlighting local talent. We reserve at least two slots for local speakers. Individual talks will be considered local if at least half of the speakers are from the tri-state region-that is, within typical commuting distance of Manhattan. In the past, these slots have been less competitive than the other talk slots, so if you live in the tri-state region we strongly urge you to submit a proposal.</p>

              <h3>Proposals</h3>
              <h4>A good proposal for your talk will include:</h4>
              <ul class='talk-points'>
                <li class='talk'>Concise explanation or outline of your talk</li>
                <li class='bio'>Short biographical statement about you and your involvement in the Ruby community</li>
                <li class='location'>Your city and state of residence</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Notation</h4>
              <p>All proposals must specify exactly who will be presenting. For example, we will not accept proposals from companies unless they specify who will be presenting on behalf of the company. Presentations may be given by more than one person, but multiple speakers will split the honorarium and travel reimbursement.</p>
              <h4>Video</h4>
              <p>We will be videotaping all the talks, and making this video freely available online under a Creative Commons license. You should be okay with this if you are submitting a talk.</p>
