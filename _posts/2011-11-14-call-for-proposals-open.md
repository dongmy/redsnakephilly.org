Our Call for Proposals is open! [Last year's talks](http://trevmex.com/post/3198570101/redsnake-1st-annual-philly-ruby-python-meetup-notes) were really fantastic, and we expecting that the excellent developer community here in the greater Philadelphia area can level-up to do themselves one better. So get your thinking caps on and start sending proposals to <info@redsnakephilly.org>.
