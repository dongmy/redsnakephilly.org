  <h2>About RedSnakePhilly</h2>
  <p>
  The RedSnake is a meeting where Rubyists and Pythonistas get together to throw down some hard tech and see how we measure up. Ultimately we aim to accomplish the following:
  </p>
  <ol class="goals">
    <li>To be the premier technical event for hardcore programmers in Philadelphia</li>
    <li>To inspire and provide an environment of learning to those who are new to programming</li>
    <li>To introduce Philadelphia's top companies to Philadelphia's top programmers</li>
    <li>To raise national recognition for Philadelphia's tech community and attract top talent to the city</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The format is 2 hours of alternating 10 minute lightning talks. It's intense, technical, and mind blowing.</p>
