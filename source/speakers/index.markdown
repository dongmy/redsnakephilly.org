  <div class='title'>The Game of Hangman, Decision Theory and Delivering Software</div>
    <div class='author'>Chris Conley</div>
  <div class='abstract'>
Information entropy and utility functions. Bitmaps, makefiles and python generators. Who knew the seemingly simple game of hangman could be so much fun? And what does it all have to do with delivering software?<br/>
During the talk, we'll solve the game starting with our naive childhood strategy then improve the strategy with some simple decision theory tricks. Along the way, we'll build a model for feedback, information gain and failure that we can apply directly to the way we deliver software.

  <div class='title'>Lapis - the Web Framework that Runs Inside Nginx</div>
    <div class='author'>Stefan Natchev</div>
  <div class='abstract'>
  Lapis is a small, yet feature-rich framework for Lua (and Moonscript!). Although obviously inspired by Rails, it stays true to Lua's philosophy of being small, simple to understand and composable. Because it relies on Nginx event loop, all actions including HTTP requests and database queries are asynchronous. With the power of Lua coroutines code is written synchronously but runs asynchronously, without all that callback spaghetti seen in other asynchronous platforms. It's fast, easy to read, and easy to write.

<div class='title'>Docker for Testing, Shipping, and Deploying</div>
  <div class='pic' ><img alt="eric_windisch" src="{{root_url}}/images/speakers/eric_windisch.jpg"/></div>
  <div class='author'>Eric Windisch</div>
  <div class='abstract'>
  Docker is gaining popularity in testing, shipping, and deploying applications. What is it? How does it compare to Ruby's bundler/RVM or Python's virtualenv? Eric will introduce you to Docker and will provide answers to these questions.
