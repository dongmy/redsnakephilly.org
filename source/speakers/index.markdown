We've got an exciting list of speakers this year. The list below is just a sampling for now, we will add speakers as they are confirmed.

    Vision Spreadsheet is an application designed to explore and solve computer vision problems. It provides a visual environment and a familiar computational tool set to enable creative prototyping of computer vision algorithms. A novel interface using a spreadsheet of images encourages interactive and exploratory algorithm design. Computational scientists can leverage their existing knowledge of Python, NumPy, SciPy, OpenCV, and other familiar technologies. Vision Spreadsheet aims to make the techniques of computer vision accessible to a wider audience.

  <div class='title'> Using SimPy to Model AWS Autoscaling for Realtime Computation</div>

  <div class='abstract'>
    Our company needed to do realtime analysis of surveillance video
    clips, but the arrival rate of those clips varied greatly over the
    course of a day. Would a planned system using AWS Autoscaling have
    acceptable performance and cost? This talk describes how I modeled
    that planned system using a Python discrete event simulation package
    to find out.

    Daniel Williams has been an independent consultant doing software
    development for over 25 years. Real time 3D graphics visualization
    systems, "smart" video surveillance devices and cloud-hosted web
    backends are some of the things he's built in Python. He really likes
    building things.
