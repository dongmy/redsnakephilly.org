  <a href="http://bluebox.net">Blue Box Group</a> is a premier Rails hosting provider with managed
hosting and flexible cloud, dedicated, and hybrid solutions. Our
experts bring top-tier operations and configuration support during
deploys, migrations, and maintenance, allowing you to focus on writing
great code. We're committed to providing the best possible
infrastructure for your application, period.

We've worked in the Rails community since 2006 and are devoted to
maintaining close relationships with our partners. Since the
beginning, we've stuck to our roots: we're the backend systems experts
to compliment your team.

We combine our proprietary cloud operating system with dedicated high
performance database servers to maximize performance and scalability.
There's no need to re-architect applications to work around the
limitations of a platform.

With full SSH and root access, you can pick your application stack, or
work with our engineering team to implement our recommendation. The
important part is that the choice is yours.

You can get started with a single server for a staging site, or a work
with us to build a custom cluster for your production environment
right off the bat.</p>

  <a href="http://pivotallabs.com"><img class="pic" src="../images/content/pivot.png" alt="pivot" style="width:350px; float:left; padding:15px;"/></a><p>As the customer, you play the key role in the development process. Your involvement with the team shapes what gets done, when. You determine the backlog of features to be developed, and you determine their relative priority. You make those decisions informed by the relative cost of the features in your backlog, since you can see at any moment what the relative cost of those features is, in terms of points. Pivotal Tracker lets you rearrange stories to your heart's content, and always keeps you informed of the impact your choices make on the schedule, and by extension, on cost. One thing you may be surprised by is how our development teams respond to changes in priorities. They respond by doing whatever it is you asked them to do, in whatever order you choose. They are confident that they've exposed the cost to you, and they trust you to make informed choices about what the highest priority is. For many of our customers, this is a revelatory experience. For us, it's just the sign of a healthy relationship between the development and product teams.</p>
