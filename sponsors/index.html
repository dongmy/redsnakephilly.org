  <a href="http://bluebox.net">Blue Box Group</a> is a premier Rails hosting provider with managed
hosting and flexible cloud, dedicated, and hybrid solutions. Our
experts bring top-tier operations and configuration support during
deploys, migrations, and maintenance, allowing you to focus on writing
great code. We're committed to providing the best possible
infrastructure for your application, period.

We've worked in the Rails community since 2006 and are devoted to
maintaining close relationships with our partners. Since the
beginning, we've stuck to our roots: we're the backend systems experts
to compliment your team.

We combine our proprietary cloud operating system with dedicated high
performance database servers to maximize performance and scalability.
There's no need to re-architect applications to work around the
limitations of a platform.

With full SSH and root access, you can pick your application stack, or
work with our engineering team to implement our recommendation. The
important part is that the choice is yours.

You can get started with a single server for a staging site, or a work
with us to build a custom cluster for your production environment
right off the bat.</p>
