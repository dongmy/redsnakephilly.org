    <li><a name="smith"><strong>Ryan Smith</a> - Fewer Constraints More Concurrency</strong></li>
    <p>
    Traditional data structures like stacks and queues are 
    strict - perhaps too strict. In this talk I will showcase some 
    classical data structures and then provide alternative 
    constraints that will allow our algorithms to achieve a 
    greater level of concurrency. Examples will include a mix 
    of Ruby and Postgres.
    Ryan Smith's educational background consists of 
    Computer Science and Mathematics. He has contributed 
    to projects like Queue Classic, ActiveMerchant, 
    Gemcutter and others. These days he is crafting code on 
    the API Team at Heroku</p>

    <li><a name="metz"><strong>Sandi Metz</a> - Less: The Path to Better Design</strong></li>
    <p>
    The concrete principles of object-oriented design are useful but are built upon powerful concepts that the 
    principles tend to obscure. When design principles 
    become goals in and of themselves, object-oriented 
    design gets a bad name and applications suffer.
    This talk strips away the well-known design principles and 
    exposes the hidden, underlying goals of design. It reveals 
    programming techniques that allow you to write less code 
    while creating beautiful, flexible applications. These techniques all involve less. Doing less, debugging less, testing 
    less and knowing less, all in service of achieving more.
    Sandi Metz works for Duke University in Durham, N.C., is 
    a member of the West End Ruby group and is one of the 
    many DevChix. Her lengthy and varied career has led her 
    to Ruby, in which she has happily spent the last 6+ years 
    crafting applications both large and small. When not thinking, talking or writing about object-oriented design she can 
    be found building bikes in her garage. Her commitment to 
    OOD is paired with a firm belief that one can never have 
    too many bikes.</p>


    <li><a name="casimir"><strong>Jeff Casimir</a> - Blow Up Your Views</strong></li>
    <p>
    Whether you're new to Rails or have been around a few 
    years, chances are that your views are primitive. Detonate 
    what you know about how views are written and lets start over.
    Jeff Casimir runs JumpstartLab where he travels the Earth 
    teaching Ruby and Rails techniques. He loves talking to 
    developers, learning about their best ideas and then 
    spreading them.

    <li><a name="rosenthal"><strong>Casey Rosenthal</a> - HysteriaEngine: Ruby Does Violence in the Name of Science</strong></li>
    <p>
    I will present the inner workings of my Ruby algorithm, 
    called HysteriaEngine, which uses personality profiles to 
    generate human-like behavior for an agent, in this case a 
    bot that plays in UnrealTournament2004. I will cover the 
    stack needed to run the bot, using Ruby on top of a little 
    Java, but primarily I will deconstruct the algorithm that 
    generates the commands that drive the bot, code structure 
    decisions in designing the algorithm, and the complexity 
    involved in generating human-like behavior. I will also 
    touch on some of the obstacles of TDD-ing a stochastic 
    model that often has purposefully unpredictable results.
    Casey Rosenthal is Chief Software Engineer for Port Forty 
    Nine, currently working for NASA, Caltech, and JPL to 
    engineer systems for storing and disseminating the image 
    archives of space telescopes such as Hubble, Spitzer, 
    Chandra, etc. He is writing a chapter on using personality 
    profiles in artificially intelligent bots for an upcoming book 
    titled “Believable Bots,” to be published in late 2011

    <li><a name="ashkenas"><strong>Jeremy Ashkenas</a> - CoffeeScript for the Well-Rounded Rubyist</strong></li>
    <p>
    You may have heard the controversy about CoffeeScript 
    becoming the default client-side language in Rails 3.1. 
    We'll tackle CoffeeScript (and JavaScript) from a Rubyist's 
    perspective, comparing object models, closures, syntax 
    and more. Learning about CoffeeScript can help highlight 
    the Ruby-ish parts of JavaScript.
    Jeremy Ashkenas is part of the Interactive News team 
    at the New York Times, as well as the lead developer of 
    DocumentCloud, helping news organizations analyze and 
    publish the primary source documents behind the news. 
    He works on CoffeeScript, Backbone.js, Underscore.js, 
    Docco, Jammit, and Ruby-Processing, among other opensource projects

    <li><a name="crepezzi"><strong>John Crepezzi &amp; Mat Brown</a> - Using Your Database</strong> </li>
    <p>
    Being eager to quickly develop our applications and 
    libraries, we often skip over technologies and techniques 
    that have existed for years. Particularly where relational 
    databases are concerned, Rails encourages us to do as 
    much as possible in Ruby, even when our database has 
    the same functionality built-in. This talk will take a step 
    back and see what existing technologies we've reinvented, 
    and compare them with the performance of tried-and-true 
    approaches.
    Mat Brown has been programming in Ruby and Rails for 
    three years, and is the creator of several open-source 
    libraries, most notably Sunspot. He thinks Ruby's patternmatching constructs are underappreciated. Mat currently 
    works as the lead engineer for Clique. John Crepezzi is 
    a Rails developer at Patch Media in New York City. He 
    created several popular gems, such as IceCube, TrackHistory, and EasyTranslate. He loves traveling and talking 
    about how much he loves to code/solve problems

    <li><a name="phoenix"><strong>Evan Phoenix</a> - Build it and they will come (Rubinius Edition)</strong></li>
    <p>
    After years of work, Rubinius is hitting its stride. In his talk, 
    Evan will talk about how you can decide when Rubinius is 
    a good fit for you and what you can expect in the rest of 
    2011 and beyond.
    Evan Phoenix works for Engine Yard where he is a lead 
    Rubinius developer. The Los Angeles weather allows him 
    to take long walks on the beach whenever he would like
