  <p>We&#8217;ve got an exciting list of speakers this year. The list below is just a sampling for now, we will add speakers as they are confirmed.</p>

  <div class='title'> Vision Spreadsheet: An Environment for Computer Vision </div>
  <div class='pic'>
    <img alt="Scott Determan" src="/images/speakers/scott_determan.jpg"/>  </div>
  <div class='author'> Scott Determan <a href="http://twitter.com/MonkScott"> @MonkScott </a> </div>
  <div class='abstract'>
    Vision Spreadsheet is an application designed to explore and solve computer vision problems. It provides a visual environment and a familiar computational tool set to enable creative prototyping of computer vision algorithms. A novel interface using a spreadsheet of images encourages interactive and exploratory algorithm design. Computational scientists can leverage their existing knowledge of Python, NumPy, SciPy, OpenCV, and other familiar technologies. Vision Spreadsheet aims to make the techniques of computer vision accessible to a wider audience.

    Scott has been building computer vision software for over twenty years. He is especially interested in vision applications for the life sciences.

  <div class='title'>A Field Guide to Ruby and Python</div>
  <div class='pic' ><img alt="Pam Selle" src="/images/speakers/pam_selle.jpg"/></div>
  <div class='author'>Pam Selle <a href="http://thewebivore.com/">http://thewebivore.com</a></div>
  <div class='abstract'>
    Trudging through the wilds and rivalries of Ruby and Python, I&#8217;ll discuss
    methods for identifying a Ruby or Python developer in the wild, the evolution
    of the languages, and more.
  </div>
  <div class='bio'>
    Pam Selle is a software engineer in the land of Rails by day and Pythonista on
    the weekends/evenings. She&#8217;s active in many developer communities, and has
    presented at Ruby meetups and at PyCon 2012. She&#8217;s also an instructor for
    GirlDevelopIt and PyStar, an open source contributor and enthusiast, and
    blogger at <a href="http://thewebivore.com">thewebivore.com</a>.

  <div class='title'> Using SimPy to Model AWS Autoscaling for Realtime Computation</div>
  <div class='pic' > <img alt="Daniel Williams" src="/images/speakers/dan_williams.jpg"/></div>
  <div class='author'>Daniel Williams <a href="http://danielwilliams.org"> http://danielwilliams.org </a></div>
  <div class='abstract'>
    Our company needed to do realtime analysis of surveillance video
    clips, but the arrival rate of those clips varied greatly over the
    course of a day. Would a planned system using AWS Autoscaling have
    acceptable performance and cost? This talk describes how I modeled
    that planned system using a Python discrete event simulation package
    to find out.
  </div>
  <div class='bio'>
    Daniel Williams has been an independent consultant doing software
    development for over 25 years. Real time 3D graphics visualization
    systems, &#8220;smart&#8221; video surveillance devices and cloud-hosted web
    backends are some of the things he&#8217;s built in Python. He really likes
    building things.

  <div class='title'>How the python got it&#8217;s stripes: Simulating nature&#8217;s patterns with Numpy</div>
  <div class='pic' ><img alt="Tom Adelman" src="/images/speakers/tom_adelman.jpg"/></div>
  <div class='author'>Tom Adelman</div>
  <div class='abstract'>
In 1952, Alan Turing suggested that reaction-diffusion dynamics could
produce some of the complex patterns found in nature, for example, the
pattern of spots on a leopard. The idea behind the model is
relatively simple, but the non-linear reactions and complicated
geometry of animals make analytical solutions difficult. Python&#8217;s
interactivity and Numpy&#8217;s speed will allow us to explore numerical
simulations of these interesting natural patterns.
  </div>
  <div class='bio'>
Tom Adelman has spent most of his career working in academic physics
and neuroscience, and has used Python and Numpy throughout,
particularly for data analysis and experiment control. Currently, Tom
works as an independent consultant designing and developing systems
for scientific research.

  <div class='title'>Testing Python Web Applications at Scale</div>

  <div class='author'>Jeffrey J. Persch</div>
  <div class='abstract'>
    How do you know your software will work at scale? This talk will examine how we 
    use Python to gain confidence in the deployment of large scale systems.

  <div class='title'>C++ templates</div>
  <div class='pic' ><img alt="David Richardson" src="/images/speakers/david_richardson.jpg"/></div>
  <div class='author'>David Richardson</div>
  <div class='abstract'>
C++ templates allow computation to be performed during compilation. Used
wisely, this flexibility allows the type system to provide additional
safety invariants and perform optimizations that are too labor intensive
for programmers and too domain specific for optimizing compilers. In
this talk, we&#8217;ll cover the basics of performing computations with
templates, develop types capable of statically preventing memory leaks,
automate some tedious type conversions, and remove needless computations
during compilation. Kyle Burton will be talking (link to his talk) about
how lisp macros can be used to similar effect.
  </div>
  <div class='bio'>
David Richardson is a software architect for an automated trading system
written in C++/python. He has been using C++ in applications
requiringrun-time performance and reliability for over 10 years. Before
working in finance, he was a researcher developing optimization
techniques forcomputer algebra and computational chemistry kernels.The
optimizations employeda combination of generic programming, template
metaprogramming, code generation, and performance measurement.

  <div class='title'>The Patterns You Can&#8217;t {See, Refactor}</div>

  <div class='abstract'>
There are patterns in your software that sit right in the middle of your
blind spot. There are many powerful tools for abstraction and
refactoring our programming languages - Lisp Macros are a tool that
allows you to abstract above the limit that is exists in most
programming languages. In the precious 10 minutes we have together I
hope to convince you that Lisp Macros represent an unique, powerful tool
and that learning more about them will improve you as a programmer.
