  <div class='author'> Scott Determan <a href="http://twitter.com/MonkScott"> @MonkScott </a> </div>
  <div class='abstract'>
    Vision Spreadsheet is an application designed to explore and solve computer vision problems. It provides a visual environment and a familiar computational tool set to enable creative prototyping of computer vision algorithms. A novel interface using a spreadsheet of images encourages interactive and exploratory algorithm design. Computational scientists can leverage their existing knowledge of Python, NumPy, SciPy, OpenCV, and other familiar technologies. Vision Spreadsheet aims to make the techniques of computer vision accessible to a wider audience.

  <div class='abstract'>
Ruby and Rails are approaching adulthood. Enterprise and startup companies alike have made large investments into the Ruby and Rails community. The upcoming release of Ruby 2.0 and Rails 4.0 represents some interesting steps for both the maintainers and users of these projects. We&#8217;ll explore the current and future impacts this has on the feature set and the communities.

  <div class='title'> Using SimPy to Model AWS Autoscaling for Realtime Computation</div>
  <div class='pic' > <img alt="Daniel Williams" src="/images/speakers/dan_williams.jpg"/></div>
  <div class='author'>Daniel Williams <a href="http://danielwilliams.org"> http://danielwilliams.org </a></div>
  <div class='abstract'>
    Our company needed to do realtime analysis of surveillance video
    clips, but the arrival rate of those clips varied greatly over the
    course of a day. Would a planned system using AWS Autoscaling have
    acceptable performance and cost? This talk describes how I modeled
    that planned system using a Python discrete event simulation package
    to find out.
  </div>
  <div class='bio'>
    Daniel Williams has been an independent consultant doing software
    development for over 25 years. Real time 3D graphics visualization
    systems, &#8220;smart&#8221; video surveillance devices and cloud-hosted web
    backends are some of the things he&#8217;s built in Python. He really likes
    building things.

  <div class='title'>Building Command-line Applications with Ruby</div>
  <div class='pic' ><img alt="Hector Castro" src="/images/speakers/hcastro.jpg"/></div>

  <div class='abstract'>
    Command-line applications are beautiful.  They can be easily automated
    using scripts, they&#8217;re fast, they&#8217;re lightweight, and they&#8217;re
    efficient.  Building command-line applications with Ruby is relatively
    straightforward as there are several toolkits to aid with the process.

    In this talk, I&#8217;ll go through the process of building a command-line
    application in Ruby with <a href="http://whatisthor.com/">Thor</a> and testing it with <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a>/<a href="https://github.com/cucumber/aruba/">Aruba</a>.  Thor is a Ruby toolkit for building command-line
    applications.  Cucumber is a behavior-driven development framework.
    Aruba is an extension to Cucumber that allows external testing of
    command-line applications written in any language.

  <div class='bio'>
    Hector Castro is a Technical Evangelist at Basho Technologies and has
    been an active member of the Philadelphia tech community since early
    2009.  He spends most of the day telling computers what to do, but
    because he doesn&#8217;t know how they work, it&#8217;s really an uphill battle.

  <div class='title'>How the python got it&#8217;s stripes: Simulating nature&#8217;s patterns with Numpy</div>
  <div class='pic' ><img alt="Tom Adelman" src="/images/speakers/tom_adelman.jpg"/></div>
  <div class='author'>Tom Adelman</div>
  <div class='abstract'>
In 1952, Alan Turing suggested that reaction-diffusion dynamics could
produce some of the complex patterns found in nature, for example, the
pattern of spots on a leopard. The idea behind the model is
relatively simple, but the non-linear reactions and complicated
geometry of animals make analytical solutions difficult. Python&#8217;s
interactivity and Numpy&#8217;s speed will allow us to explore numerical
simulations of these interesting natural patterns.
  </div>
  <div class='bio'>
Tom Adelman has spent most of his career working in academic physics
and neuroscience, and has used Python and Numpy throughout,
particularly for data analysis and experiment control. Currently, Tom
works as an independent consultant designing and developing systems
for scientific research.

    Want to build a native Android app but shuddering at
    the constraints put upon you by developing in Java?  Then Ruboto may be for
    you.  This development framework, spun out from the JRuby team, allows you to
    build your application in Ruby while allowing you direct access to the full
    Android Java APIs.  This talk will demonstrate the power of using Ruboto for
    your Android development.

    Rob has been coding professionally in Java and / or Ruby for 15 years.
    Currently, he serves as CTO for eLocal USA, LLC.  Outside of work, he enjoys

<h2> Special Guest Speakers </h2>


<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
  Because we don&#8217;t live in a vacuum, and we can all learn from other technologies and languages, RedSnake is proud to welcome two excellent talks on C++ and Lisp.
 </div>




<div class='speaker'>
  <div class='title'>C++ templates</div>
  <div class='pic' ><img alt="David Richardson" src="/images/speakers/david_richardson.jpg"/></div>
  <div class='author'>David Richardson</div>
  <div class='abstract'>
C++ templates allow computation to be performed during compilation. Used
wisely, this flexibility allows the type system to provide additional
safety invariants and perform optimizations that are too labor intensive
for programmers and too domain specific for optimizing compilers. In
this talk, we&#8217;ll cover the basics of performing computations with
templates, develop types capable of statically preventing memory leaks,
automate some tedious type conversions, and remove needless computations
during compilation. Kyle Burton will be talking (link to his talk) about
how lisp macros can be used to similar effect.
  </div>
  <div class='bio'>
David Richardson is a software architect for an automated trading system
written in C++/python. He has been using C++ in applications
requiringrun-time performance and reliability for over 10 years. Before
working in finance, he was a researcher developing optimization
techniques forcomputer algebra and computational chemistry kernels.The
optimizations employeda combination of generic programming, template
metaprogramming, code generation, and performance measurement.

  <div class='title'>The Patterns You Can&#8217;t {See, Refactor}</div>

  <div class='abstract'>
There are patterns in your software that sit right in the middle of your
blind spot. There are many powerful tools for abstraction and
refactoring our programming languages - Lisp Macros are a tool that
allows you to abstract above the limit that is exists in most
programming languages. In the precious 10 minutes we have together I
hope to convince you that Lisp Macros represent an unique, powerful tool
and that learning more about them will improve you as a programmer.

Kyle is the head of technology at Relay Network, working to fix Business to Consumer communication using Functional Programming and Agile methodologies as secret weapons to build Relay&#8217;s systems.
<br/>Kyle has worked in domains ranging from e-commerce to web harvesting to large scale data integration. He has a very understanding wife who puts up with his technical vagaries and two adorable daughters (both named after cities). He cooks a mean soufflé.
