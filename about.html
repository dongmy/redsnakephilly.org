  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    The Gotham Ruby Conference (GoRuCo) is a one-day event that will take place in
    New York City on Saturday, May 30th. It will be a technical conference aimed at
    highly motivated programmers interested in all things Ruby. You'll spend the
    day among Rubyists, Rails developers, and language enthusiasts in New York City,
    home of Silicon Alley. The agenda will feature 5-6 speakers and an open session of
    lightning talks by attendees.

    We'll be starting the day at 9:00 am with registration, and the last talk will
    conclude at 6:45 pm. Pace University will be providing the venue. We can accommodate a
    wide range of dietary restrictions; if you have any special needs you should contact

    attendees will be provided at a local bar later that evening.

  <p>Attendance is limited to 150 people and will be opening in April.</p>
