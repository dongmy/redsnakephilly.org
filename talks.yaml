- :title: Linear Regression, Python, and Beer
  :speaker: Mike DeLaurentis
  :lang: Python

  :abstract: "Linear Regression is a simple, powerful, and widely-used
  technique for estimating the parameters of a function. It is often
  used to predict the value of an unknown variable based on one or more
  input variables and some historical data. There are a few different
  methods for solving linear regressions using least squares, and some
  very easy ways to do it in Python. We will talk about some of the
  history and theory behind linear regression, show how to implement it
  in Python, and discuss how it can be applied to real-world problems
  like predicting the percent alcohol of home-brewed beer."

- :title: Pandas
  :lang: Python
  :speaker: John Granieri
  :abstract: "Python and its broad standard library have frequently been
  used as the glue language in data transformation and analysis
  pipelines. There is an evolving set of modules and Python data types
  that help Python become a complete environment for many data analysis
  tasks, and Pandas looks like a promising key component to this
  growing area. From <a href=\"http://pandas.sourceforge.net\">http://pandas.sourceforge.net</a>: \"pandas is a Python
  package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures
  designed to make working with relational or labeled data both easy and
  intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for
  doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python.\" Pandas is under
  development by Wes McKinney and several others. John will introduce
  the group to pandas and demo it as fast as he can."
  :bio: "John Granieri works at SIG, a global financial trading firm
  headquartered in Bala Cynwyd, on systems for trading strategy
  research, development, and optimization. He did graduate work on
  real-time 3D animation systems. He has used and been a proponent of
  Python for over 15 years."

  :abstract: "Much of the data released by government agencies has a
            spatial component to it. Dana will present basic techniques of spatial
            data analysis, along with python libraries and python-based tools for
            exploring and mapping open data."
  :bio: "Dana Bauer works as a spatial analyst and mapmaker at Azavea, a
        geospatial analysis firm specializing in location-based web and mobile
        application development. Dana has a background in geography,
        statistics, and science writing.  As part of the PhillyPUG leadership
        team, she organizes Python workshops and project nights for new

  :speaker: Kyle Gorman
  :lang: Python
  :twitter: "@killa__bee"
  :abstract: "Ira Glass, host of NPR\'s popular talk show \"This American
              Life\", has a difficult-to-place accent. Python is the glue holding
              together homebrewed C libraries, shell programs, and R and Praat code,
              that allows Kyle to automatically measure the acoustic properties of
              Glass\' radio voice and to compare his speech to that of other speakers
              from across North America."
  :bio: "Kyle Gorman is a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Linguistics
at the University of Pennsylvania, where he uses Python and C to study
the statistical properties of human language. His Erdős number is 4."
- :title: What I Talk About When I Talk About Python
  :lang: Python
  :speaker: Hunter Blanks
  :twitter: "@tildehblanks"
  :abstract: "This talk asks two questions: \"What is it like to use Python
      after using other tools and languages?\" and \"What is it like to use
      other tools and languages after using Python?\" For a brief (and
      inevitably incomplete) answer, this talk turns to three topics as they
      apply in software: the process of learning, the ability to make
      friends through a text, and how one may wisely or unwisely go about
      solving technical problems."
  :bio: "Hunter Blanks works in Python and JavaScript as an engineer
      and technical lead. Before joining Monetate in 2009, he worked as the
      lead programmer at a Ruby on Rails startup in Philadelphia, and as a
      programmer/sysadmin at a wireless engineering firm in Berkeley,
      California. Hunter holds a B.A. in Classical Languages (Greek and Latin
      -- not Fortran and C :-) from UC Berkeley and enjoys reading, flying
      small aircraft, and helping people build solutions to technical
      problems."

  :abstract: "Active Support is a collection of utility classes, standard library extensions, and patterns.  Extracted out of the Rails project, many Ruby devs take for granted what Active Support brings to the table.  In this talk, we will see how the ActiveSupport library produces nicer Ruby code and look to see how it works its magic. https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activesupport"

  :title: "What goes on under the Red Cloth?"
  :abstract: "Every few years, Jason undertakes a rewrite of RedCloth—from regular expressions to state machines to packrats and PEGs—he\'s tried them all in his quest to efficiently parse and transform Textile, one of the most complex formatting languages in existence. Take a ride on his perpetual dissatisfaction machine and judge for yourself whether he\'s finally found \"the one\" or is just setting himself up for another heartbreak."
  :bio: "Jason has been doing web development for 15 years and Ruby development since 2005. He is a recent immigrant to Philly, but felt immediately at home in Center City, where he does freelance web development. Why the lucky stiff gave him RedCloth in 2008 along with a small endowment of bacon for its upkeep. The bacon ran out the day _why disappeared."

  :title: "A practical introduction to continuations."
  :abstract: "A continuation is an object that represents the control state of a process at a particular moment (instruction pointer and call stack). We can save this state and later restore it, to manipulate the flow of execution in unusual ways. We will start with a trivial example and build up to a technique for using a blocking API, concurrently, without threads."
  :bio: "Dustin works in enterprise cloud computing, and wrestles Java into submission on a daily basis. He is fascinated by decomposing ugly, complex abstractions into simple, elegant primitives, and thinks functional-oriented thinking helps make programming more like Legos. If you\'ve written software people use in a functional language, I\'d love to pick your mind over a beer."

  :title: "Startups & Ruby on Rails: A Learning Experience"
  :abstract: "Working within the startup field requires the ability to rapidly prototype, gain feedback, and quickly make changes that can completely alter one's development timeline. This is especially true when working with technology-based startups, that require minimal viable products to prove their concept before making a large development investment. This talk examines the pros and cons of using Ruby (and the Rails framework), from the perspective of a newcomer to the language, with a focus on startup applications."
  :bio: "Tim is a recent graduate from the University of Delaware, majoring in computer science and minoring in psychology and cognitive science. Research was a major focal point of Tim's undergraduate career, which eventually led to his entrepreneurial interests in startups in the Philadelphia / Delaware area. He is currently a doctoral candidate studying computer science (UD), and is heavily involved in the entrepreneurial community. His current endeavors involve web-application development for Chimp Flix (chimpflix.com) and USEED (useed.co)."
