Title: Happier Coding with ActiveSupport

Abstract: Active Support is a collection of utility classes, standard library extensions, and patterns.  Extracted out of the Rails project, many Ruby devs take for granted what Active Support brings to the table.  In this talk, we will see how the ActiveSupport library produces nicer Ruby code and look to see how it works its magic. https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activesupport

Dustin Getz <dustin.getz@gmail.com> - @dustingetz - "A practical introduction to continuations." A continuation is an object that represents the control state of a process at a particular moment (instruction pointer and call stack). We can save this state and later restore it, to manipulate the flow of execution in unusual ways. We will start with a trivial example and build up to a technique for using a blocking API, concurrently, without threads.
  Bio : Dustin works in enterprise cloud computing, and wrestles Java into submission on a daily basis. He is fascinated by decomposing ugly, complex abstractions into simple, elegant primitives, and thinks functional-oriented thinking helps make programming more like Legos. If you've written software people use in a functional language, I'd love to pick your mind over a beer.

Mike DeLaurentis - Linear Regression, Python, and Beer
Linear regression is a simple, powerful, and widely-used technique for estimating the parameters of a function. It is often used to predict the value of an unknown variable based on one or more input variables and some historical data. There are a few different methods for solving linear regressions using least squares, and some very easy ways to do it in Python. We will talk about some of the history and theory behind linear regression, show how to implement it in Python, and discuss how it can be applied to real-world problems like predicting the percent alcohol of homebrewed beer.
Mike DeLaurentis studies Computer Science at Drexel and makes beer at home.
