"Vagrant: Virtualize your dev environment"
See how I use Vagrant to keep my application environment easily encapsulated, maintained and configured.
Bio: Nick is a software engineer for IBM by day and a hacker with hobbies
in data visualization and GIS by night. A Drexel alum and member of
several Philly tech groups, Nick is a strong believer in the Philly
tech scene and thinks events like Red Snake are a great start to bring
national recognition to our city.

"Happier Coding with ActiveSupport"
Active Support is a collection of utility classes, standard library extensions, and patterns.  Extracted out of the Rails project, many Ruby devs take for granted what Active Support brings to the table.  In this talk, we will see how the ActiveSupport library produces nicer Ruby code and look to see how it works its magic. https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activesupport

"What goes on under the Red Cloth?"
 Every few years, Jason undertakes a rewrite of RedCloth—from regular expressions to state machines to packrats and PEGs—he's tried them all in his quest to efficiently parse and transform Textile, one of the most complex formatting languages in existence. Take a ride on his perpetual dissatisfaction machine and judge for yourself whether he's finally found "the one" or is just setting himself up for another heartbreak.
Bio: Jason has been doing web development for 15 years and Ruby development since 2005. He is a recent immigrant to Philly, but felt immediately at home in Center City, where he does freelance web development. Why the lucky stiff gave him RedCloth in 2008 along with a small endowment of bacon for its upkeep. The bacon ran out the day _why disappeared.

"A practical introduction to continuations."
A continuation is an object that represents the control state of a process at a particular moment (instruction pointer and call stack). We can save this state and later restore it, to manipulate the flow of execution in unusual ways. We will start with a trivial example and build up to a technique for using a blocking API, concurrently, without threads.
Bio : Dustin works in enterprise cloud computing, and wrestles Java into submission on a daily basis. He is fascinated by decomposing ugly, complex abstractions into simple, elegant primitives, and thinks functional-oriented thinking helps make programming more like Legos. If you've written software people use in a functional language, I'd love to pick your mind over a beer.


Python:

Mike DeLaurentis - Linear Regression, Python, and Beer
Linear regression is a simple, powerful, and widely-used technique for estimating the parameters of a function. It is often used to predict the value of an unknown variable based on one or more input variables and some historical data. There are a few different methods for solving linear regressions using least squares, and some very easy ways to do it in Python. We will talk about some of the history and theory behind linear regression, show how to implement it in Python, and discuss how it can be applied to real-world problems like predicting the percent alcohol of homebrewed beer.
Bio: Mike DeLaurentis studies Computer Science at Drexel and makes beer at home.
